Rain Detection with Arduino ESP8266
Overview
This project utilizes Arduino and ESP8266 to create a Rain Detection system. The setup includes a Rain Drop sensor that detects rainfall, and when rain is detected, it triggers a notification via Line Notify. Additionally, the system incorporates a weather monitoring feature that provides updates on weather conditions every hour.

Components
ESP8266: The ESP8266 serves as the main microcontroller, connecting the project to the internet and facilitating communication with the Line Notify API.

Rain Drop Sensor: This sensor is responsible for detecting rainfall. It provides an analog signal that is read by the Arduino to determine the intensity of the rain.

Line Notify: The project integrates with Line Notify to send instant notifications when rain is detected. Line Notify offers a simple and efficient way to push messages to a Line group or user.

Features
Rain Detection: The Rain Drop sensor constantly monitors the presence and intensity of rainfall.

Line Notify Integration: When rain is detected, the system sends a notification to a Line group or user using Line Notify, keeping users informed about the weather conditions.

Weather Monitoring: The system includes a weather monitoring feature that gathers and sends weather updates every hour. This information can be customized based on your specific requirements.

Setup Instructions
Hardware Setup: Connect the Rain Drop sensor to the Arduino, and the Arduino to the ESP8266. Ensure proper power supply and wiring.

Line Notify Configuration: Obtain a Line Notify API key and configure it in the code to enable notification functionality.

Weather Monitoring Configuration: Adjust the weather monitoring settings as needed, such as the specific weather parameters to be monitored and reported.

Upload Code: Upload the Arduino code to the ESP8266 using the Arduino IDE.

Run the System: Power on the system, and it will start monitoring rain and providing weather updates.

Usage
Keep the system powered on for continuous rain monitoring and weather updates.
Check the Line group or user for instant notifications when rain is detected.
